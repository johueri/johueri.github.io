				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am currently a software development apprentice at We Can Code It. I will complete my term with We Can Code It before the end of this year.Prior to my apprenticeship I had 6 years of experience of working in communications and campaigns.</p> 
				<p>Most recently,  I was the Director of Communication for a renewable energy company in Houston Texas. While there I wrote the company's public-facing copy as well as internal policy memos, I acted as it's liaison to government offices, organized events, and redesigned their website. Coding was one part of my prior jobs, and following my work at We Can Code It,  I'd like to make it the primary focus of my career going forward.</p>
